\subsection{Evaluation of $u(\gup^k_\ell)$}
\label{sec-evaluation-G}
In this section, we develop analytical expressions for the utilities when considering the strategy $\gup^k_\ell$ against a default player. In fact, it is possible to express $u(\gup^k_\ell)$ as a rational function (\ie, a quotient of two polynomials). In particular, these functions can be evaluated to any degree of precision, which allowed us to establish the results of section \ref{sec-dec}.

\begin{subsubsection}{Scenario}
There are two miners (or, more generally, pools of miners), labelled Miner 0 and Miner 1. Miner 0 follows the \cdf{} strategy, that is, they will always mine on top of the longest chain, regardless of where their past blocks are. On the other hand, Miner 1 plays with the $\gup^k_\ell$ strategy: given a portion of at most $k$ blocks not owned by her at the end of the blockchain, she forks at the beginning of this chain (we refer to $k$ as the disadvantage). When forking, she establishes a give-up length $\ell$ such that she will give up the fork if the main branch achieves to append $\ell$ blocks, orphaning all mined blocks on the fork. This scenario captures the fact that, with reasonable hash power, a pool does not want to fork too far behind, and will give up the fork if it does not prove successful, before reaching a hopeless situation.
\end{subsubsection}


%A_1 & = & \frac{\alpha \cdot \beta \cdot h}{1 - \alpha}\\
%A_2 & = & \alpha \cdot \beta \cdot h\\

\begin{mythm}
Miner 1, with hash power $h$, fixes a disadvantage $k$, a give-up length $\ell$, and plays with $\gup^k_\ell$. Miner 0 plays with $\cdf$. 
The utility of miner 1 is given by
$$
u_1(\gup^k_\ell)(h) = \frac{\Phi_{k,\ell}(h)}{1-\Gamma_{k,\ell}(h)},
$$
where $\Phi_{k,\ell},\Gamma_{k,\ell}$ are polynomials in $h$ (with coefficients depending on $k,\ell,\alpha$ and $\beta$).
\end{mythm}
In the proof of this theorem, we develop precise expressions for $\Phi_{k,\ell}, \Gamma_{k,\ell}$. These are combinations of two sets of polynomials we call Trapezoidal and Pentagonal Dyck polynomials ($T_{n,m}, P_{n,m}$, see \ref{sec-trapezoid-pentagon}). In what follows, let $x = \beta^2 \cdot h \cdot (1 - h)$ for the ease of notation.
\begin{proof}
The game begins with both players mining on $\varepsilon$, and assume that Miner 0 first appends $j$ blocks. Here, five types of states can arise:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(0)] (Case $j=0$) Miner 1 immediately appends a block $b$ on top of $\varepsilon$ and now both players will mine on top of $b$.
    \item[(a)] After miner 0 appends $j\leq k$ blocks on top of $\varepsilon$, miner 1 appends one block on top of $\varepsilon$ and starts the fork. Miner 1 wins the fork, gaining at most $j+\ell+1$ blocks.
    \item[(b)] After miner 0 appends $j > k$ blocks on top of $\varepsilon$, miner 1 appends one block at position $j-k$. Miner 1 wins the fork, gaining at most $k+\ell+1$ blocks.
    \item[(c)] After miner 0 appends $j\leq k$ blocks on top of $\varepsilon$, miner 1 appends one block on top of $\varepsilon$ and starts the fork. Miner 0's branch achieves length $\ell+1$ and miner 1 gives up.
    \item[(d)] After miner 0 appends $j > k$ blocks on top of $\varepsilon$, miner 1 appends one block at position $j-k$. Miner 0's branch achieves length $\ell+1$ and miner 1 gives up.
\end{itemize}

A key observation is that after one of this cases, both players will mine over the same block, and reboot the strategies as if this block were $\varepsilon$. This recursive behaviour allows us to compute the utility of single forks in the same spirit as in \ref{thm:always_fork}, and then use proper shifting to establish an equation in $u_1(\gup^k_\ell)(h)$. In other words, we have

$$u_1(\gup^k_\ell)(h) = u_0(h) + \sum_{j=1}^k (u_{a,j}(h) + u_{c,j}(h)) + \sum_{j=k+1}^\infty (u_{b,j}(h) + u_{d,j}(h)),$$
where each term corresponds to the total utility contributed by the cases above. In what follows, we develop expressions for each of these terms.

\begin{subsubsection}{Case (0)} Every state $q$ in this case is of the form $1\cdot w$, where $w\in \bstring$, and thus the utility amounts to
\begin{align*}
u_0(h) &= (1-\beta) \cdot \sum_{w\in \bstring}\beta^{1+|w|} (\alpha + \alpha\cdot r_1(w))\cdot h \cdot \pr(w).\\
    &= (1-\beta) \frac{\alpha\cdot \beta \cdot h}{1-\beta} + \alpha\cdot\beta\cdot h \cdot(1-\beta) \sum_{w\in \bstring}\beta^{|w|} r_1(w) \cdot \pr(w)\\
    &= \alpha\cdot \beta \cdot h + \alpha\cdot\beta\cdot h\cdot u_1(\gup^k_\ell)(h),
\end{align*}
\end{subsubsection}


\begin{subsubsection}{Case (a)}
These states are all of the form 
$$q = 0^j\cdot 1\cdot d\cdot 1\cdot w, d\in \Dyck_{j-1}, |d|+j \leq 2\ell, w\in \bstring,$$ 
where $\Dyck_{j-1}$ are Dyck words with disadvantage $j-1$.

We have
\begin{align*}
u_{a,j}(h) &= (1-\beta) \cdot \sum_{w\in \bstring, d\in \Dyck_{j-1}, |d| \leq 2\ell-j}\beta^{|d|+j+1+|w|} \bigg(\sum_{i=0}^{(|d|+j)/2}\alpha^{i+1} + \alpha^{(|d|+j)/2 + 1} r(w)\bigg) h^{(|d|+j)/2 + 1}(1-h)^{(|d|+j)/2} \pr(w).

    &= \frac{\alpha\cdot\beta\cdot h}{1-\alpha}\cdot x^j(T_{j-1,\ell-j}(x)-\alpha^{j+1}\cdot T_{j-1,\ell-j}(\alpha\cdot x)) + \alpha\cdot\beta\cdot h\cdot(\alpha \cdot x)^j\cdot T_{j-1,\ell-j}(\alpha\cdot x)\cdot u_1(\gup^k_\ell)(h),

where $T_{n,m}$ is defined on section \ref{sec-trapezoid-pentagon}.

Analogously as before, we have
\begin{align*}
u_{b,j}(h) &= (1-\beta) \cdot \sum_{w\in \bstring, d\in \Dyck_{k-1}, |d| \leq 2\ell-k}\beta^{j+|d|+k+1+|w|} \bigg(\alpha^{j-k}\cdot \sum_{i=0}^{(|d|+k)/2}\alpha^{i+1} + \alpha^{(|d|-k)/2 + j + 1} r(w)\bigg) h^{(|d|+k)/2 + 1}(1-h)^{(|d|-k)/2 + j} \pr(w).
\end{align*}
Developing and simplifying this expression as the latter case yields
\begin{align*}
u_{b,j}(h) &= \frac{\alpha\cdot\beta\cdot h}{1-\alpha}\cdot \alpha^{j-k}\cdot \beta^{j+k}\cdot h^{k}\cdot (1-h)^{j}\big(T_{k-1,\ell-k}(x)-\alpha^{k+1}\cdot T_{k-1,\ell-k}(\alpha\cdot x)\big) \\
&+ \alpha\cdot\beta\cdot h\cdot \alpha^j\cdot\beta^{j+k}\cdot h^{k}\cdot(1-h)^{j}\cdot T_{k-1,\ell-k}(\alpha\cdot x)\cdot  u_1(\gup^k_\ell)(h).
\end{align*}

\begin{subsubsection}{Case (c)}
These states are of the form 
$$q = 0^j\cdot 1\cdot e\cdot w, e\in \Pent_{j-1,\ell-j+1}, w\in \bstring,$$ 
where $\Pent_{n,m}$ are all the binary strings with $m$ zeroes such that in every prefix, the number of ones minus the number of zeroes does not exceed $n$. The number of such strings is analyzed in section \ref{sec-trapezoid-pentagon}. Let us denote by $H(s)$ the Hamming weight of a binary string $s$.

This yields the following:
\begin{align*}
u_{c,j}(h) &= \alpha\cdot x\cdot (\alpha\cdot\beta\cdot(1-h))^l\cdot u_1(\gup^k_\ell)(h) \cdot  \sum_{e\in\Pent_{j-1,\ell-j-1}}(\beta\cdot h)^{H(e)}\\

As in case (c), we compute
\begin{align*}
u_{d,j}(h) &= (1-\beta) \cdot \sum_{w\in \bstring, e\in \Pent_{k-1, \ell-k-1}} \beta^{\ell+j-k+H(e)+|w|+2}\cdot \alpha^{\ell+j-k+1}\cdot r_1(w) \cdot h^{H(e)+1}\cdot(1-h)^{\ell+j-k+1}\cdot \pr(w)\\
        &= \alpha\cdot x\cdot(\alpha\cdot\beta\cdot(1-h))^{j+\ell-k}\cdot P_{\ell,k}(\beta\cdot h) \cdot u_1(\gup^k_\ell)(h).
\end{align*}



\end{subsubsection}

Putting all of these expressions together and summing over $j$ gives an equation for $u_1(\gup^k_\ell)(h)$, that solves to the claimed rational function. More precisely, we have
$$u_1(\gup^k_\ell)(h) = u_0 + \sum_{j=1}^k (u_{a,j} + u_{c,j}) + \sum_{j=k+1}^\infty (u_{b,j} + u_{d,j}) = \Phi_{k,\ell} + \Gamma_{k,\ell}\cdot u_1(\gup^k_\ell)(h),$$
where $\Phi$ is the total contribution of one fork (successful or not) and $\Gamma$ is the total shifting factor. First note that $u_{b,j}+u_{d,j}$ is a geometric sequence in $j$ with a ratio in $[0,1)$, therefore the summation converges. In particular, $\Phi_{k,\ell}$ and $\Gamma_{k,\ell}$ are polynomials in $h$ whose coefficients depend in $\alpha,\beta,\ell,k$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Trapezoidal and Pentagonal Dyck Polynomials}
\label{sec-trapezoid-pentagon}

In this section, we define two sets of polynomials that control the combinatorial nature of our game. They arise as generating polynomials of the sequences of states of fixed length. 

Recall that $\Dyck_{a,2b}$ is the set of binary strings of length $2b+a$ such that the number of ones equals the number of zeroes plus $a$, and such that for every prefix, the number of ones minus the number of zeroes is at most $a$. Now, define $\sigma_{a,b}:=|\Dyck_{a,2b}|$. Interpreting each 0 as a unitary $\uparrow$ step in $\ZZ^2$ and each 1 as a unitary $\rightarrow$ step, we have that $\sigma_{a,b}$ is the total number of $\{\uparrow,\rightarrow\}$ paths from $(0,0)$ to $(a,a+b)$ that lie within the trapezoid ${(0,0),(a,0),(a,a+b),(0,b)}$. We enumerate them in proposition \ref{enum-sigma}.

Also, from section \ref{sec-evaluation-G}, the set $\Pent_{a,b}$ consists of all binary strings with $b$ zeroes such that in every prefix, the number of ones minus the number of zeroes does not exceed $a$. Also, define $\Pent_{a,b}^r$ the number of such strings which have exactly $r$ ones, and define $\theta_{a,b}^r:= |\Pent_{a,b}^r|$. As before, note that $\theta_{a,b}^r$ is the total number of $\{\uparrow,\rightarrow\}$ paths in $\ZZ^2$ from $(0,0)$ to $(r,b)$ that lie within the pentagon $\{(0,0),(0,a),(r,r-a), (r,b), (0,b)\}$ (this is a rectangle if $r<a$). We develop a linear recurrence for $\theta_{a,b}^r$ that solves in terms of $\sigma_{a,b}$ in proposition \ref{enum-theta}. \francisco{I'll continue this on Sunday 8AM.}
