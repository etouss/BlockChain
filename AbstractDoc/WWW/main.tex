\begin{abstract}
In the consensus protocol used in most cryptocurrencies, participants are expected to perform actions, for which they are promised a reward. 
This actions are colloquially known as mining, and protocols must ensure that mining is reward-compatible: participants are expected to behave correctly if they want to maximise their gains. %Yet studying incentives behind mining actions in cryptocurrencies has proven a difficult task, as protocols are full of details and  technicalities. We are thus left without a clear understanding of the miner's incentives and their optimal behaviour, and most of what is currently know is based solely on trial and error. 
Yet studying incentives behind mining actions in cryptocurrencies has proven a difficult task, leaving us without a clear understanding of optimal miner behaviour. %, or the precise value of the incentives in cryptocurrency protocols. 

Our goal is to understand how do optimal mining strategies look like, and particularly under which circumstances are miners incentivised to fork the blockchain by mining on top of blocks which are not at the tail of the current chain.  We model mining in cryptocurrencies as a stochastic game in which players always try to 
produce new blocks, and are rewarded for it. The probability of a player producing a new block depends on the hash power of the player, that is, the proportion of the computational power she controls compared to the power of the entire network. Players then look to maximise their utility in the long run, and their best strategy depends on their hash power and the discount 
applied to the reward of each new block being mined. 
We show that if no discount is offered, then the miners do not have any incentive to fork, no matter how high their hash power is. On the other hand, when working with 
discounts similar to those in Bitcoin, miners do have an  incentive to fork, and surprisingly, they may want to do so even when they own less than half of the network's hash power.
