\section{Concluding remarks}
\label{sec-con-r}

Our model of mining via a stochastic game allows for an intuitive representation of miners' actions as strategies, 
and gives us a way of understanding the incentive of miners. 
One of the advantages of our model is its generality: it can be adapted to specify more complex 
actions, study other forms of reward and include cooperation between miners. 
We are currently looking at strategies that involve withholding 
a mined block to the rest of the network, for which we just needed a slight extension of the notion of actions. 
We would also like to study incentives under different models of cooperation between miners, and 
also other forms of equilibria in a dynamic setting. 
Lastly, we are interested in studying how to modify the Bitcoin protocol in order to ensure that default behaviour is a 
stationary equilibirum for any hash-power repartition.
